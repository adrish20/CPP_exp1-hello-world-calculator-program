<h1>Aim</h1>
<p>Downloading and installing VScode(hello world and calculator program)</p>
<hr>
<h1>Software Used</h1>
<p>VS code</p>
<hr>
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>This experiment starts with the installation of VScode. VScode is installed from their official website and configured for writing and running C++ programs.
Every programming language starts with the basic code of hello world. We have written the hello world program to get familiar with boiler plate format. Using that knowledge we have writen a basic calculator program which prints takes input two numbers from the user and calculates the sum, difference, product and division.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this experiment helped us install vs code and get familiar with it. We have learnt how to write code for c++ and about the format.</p>
